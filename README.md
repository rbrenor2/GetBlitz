## Privacy Policy

Effective Date: Dec 31, 2024

Blitz ("the App") is a MacOS application designed to monitor a user-selected folder, convert MOV files to MP4 format, and optionally delete the original MOV files. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data when you use the App.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, usage data, or other identifiable data. All operations performed by the App occur locally on your device.

2. Folder Monitoring and File Processing

The App requires access to the folder you choose in order to monitor and process MOV files. This access is granted through MacOS permissions, and the App only interacts with the folder and its contents as per your instructions. The App does not access, upload, or share any data from the selected folder.

3. Permissions

The App requests permission to access a specific folder on your device. This permission is necessary to monitor the folder and convert MOV files to MP4. The App does not access any other files, folders, or system data beyond the scope of the selected folder.

4. Third-Party Services

The App does not use or integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or analytics tools. All functionality is self-contained and performed on your device.

5. Data Security

Because the App does not transmit or store any data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. All file conversions are performed locally on your Mac.

6. User Choices

The App allows you to:

Select the folder to monitor.

Choose whether to delete the original MOV files after conversion.

These settings are controlled entirely by you, and the App does not store or share these preferences.

7. Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in a new version of the Privacy Policy, which will be made available alongside the App.

8. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the App, please contact us at [Your Contact Email].

By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.
